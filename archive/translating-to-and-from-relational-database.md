Translating To and From Relational Database
-------------------------------------------

This may be a module to convert a relational database to a structure inside Circular or to convert a structure in Circular to a relational database. The idea came out of the design of the relational language *Creator* made in 2007. The idea was, that this might make using Circular an option more easily picked.

A relational database can be built of the relational structure. In that case it should create abilities as it gets queried. It could also search source code for SQL queries and translate them to abilities. That way you’d make starting to use J Data an option easier picked.
