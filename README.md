Circular Language Spec | Root
=============================

Circular aims to become a visual programming language made from shapes and lines. It may once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.

You may find the following sections here:

- [Spec](spec)

    - An attempt at a specification of this language. More finished up content might be found here.

- [Broader View](broader-view)

    - Draft texts, that might once describe a story: ideas about how this Circular language might be used in practice.

- [Construct Drafts](constructs-drafts)

    - It may contain drafts of ideas that might not become part of the spec. Or language constructs that are just not as clearly worked out yet. Best not to expect too much from this content.

- [Archive](archive)

    - Content that may be one step away from being deleted. It is still kept in this folder in case something might become relevant again.

The material may still be a bit rough. Both in tone and in content. It might be improved step by step.

Would anyone be interested: Another repository might describe the plans, notes and TODO's around this project. Here it is: [Circular-Language-Spec-Plans](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circular-Language-Spec-Plans)
