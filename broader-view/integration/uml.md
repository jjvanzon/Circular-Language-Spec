### Loose Ideas

It is worth reconsidering UML for Symbol?  
You should consider the practical value of each of the diagram types. Symbol does provide a way to express any system.  
All systematics expressed in UML, can also be expressed in Symbol, however, the diagram types in UML do serve a practical purpose, in that they clearly depict a certain aspect of the systematics. For instance, the sequence diagram shows more clearly, exactly the order in which a process does things and easily which objects executes what thing. In Symbol you CAN express the same systematics, but the timeline may be depicted less clearly. But compared to text code the timeline is much clearer in Symbol. Of course, when you are able to express the timeline as clearly in Symbol as in the sequence diagram, you may have found a substitute for it. However, it still remains to be seem if 'normal' people, that do not really know Symbol, will take it in as easily with Symbol as with a sequence diagram. Possibly, Symbol CAN provide a good way. The use of the two dimensions in a sequence diagram is very nice. Can symbol, being more geometrical, offer the same clear view on the timeline without using the straight axis, or should symbols be placed under straight axes? Or are the reference symbols too much for 'normal' people...

Stuff like that might be considered.

It is mainly the absence of a practical view on things of me, that earlier on made me think little of UML in relation to Symbol. Perhaps, now I have gained a more practical approach to things, I will see the use for things in UML.

UML also provides in the practical points of views demanded when implementing a ICT system in real life business. A deployment diagram, for instance, is relevant for system engineering to be able to prepare the machines for use, take care of the neccesary lines, user rights & privileges, and be able to see the costs of physical equipment, and demand put on subscriber lines, for instance. So it is not just about making a single computer language, that programmers work with. The deployment diagram may be an arbitrary view on the system to a programmer. Symbol may not be fit for it.

However, in programming in Symbol is would be wise for any object that would occur in the UML diagrams, to have a place as an object in Symbol. This will include tools, users, components, computers, communication lines, and USE CASES. Use cases in my current ideas are not defined as objects or procedures in the system at all. Being able to let Symbol provide what UML provides, it is also important to specify which elements of the system are relevant for what users / in what (UML) diagrams.

In the reader about UML I am reading now, the only place where I see containment relationships physically drawn, is in the Deployment diagram. But later I see a package symbol surrounding classes in a class diagram.

en toch wordt UML weinig gebruikt en ook UML in Visio, want je kunt niet veel relevants vinden als je naar iets specifieks zoekt.

Symbol depicts the technical object oriented organization. I suspect UML does provide some practical points of view, that Symbol does not. Can Symbol somehow serve as an intermediate language which translates to UML and back? Or should something UML-like still be used to express systems in a practical way.
