Circular Language Broader View | Extensibility | Loose Ideas
============================================================

`[ Draft ]`

The Extensibility Principles should also cover the idea behind legacy modules.

## From the original Symbol documentation

### Data & Math

Data and math in Symbol are actually not part of the language. Data and math are modules written in Symbol Language that provide types and commands to work with data and math. These modules are described in separate texts. At present, it might not be convincing if the full description of a programming language should contain nothing about *strings*, *arrays*, *simple data types* and *mathematical operations*.

Therefore, in this chapter, I give a functional description of basics of the Data and Math modules.
