Encircle Language | Broader View
================================

Semantic Modeling
-----------------

May be about how Encircle language might be used to express or model meaning from reality, a possible link to artificial intelligence, natural language and generating and manipulating those models.

- ### [Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language, Neural Networks, Object Algebra](artificial-intelligence-natural-language-neural-networks-object-algebra.md)

    - It goes too far for now to consider the possibilities inside Encircle regarding these concepts. But they are mentioned here, to demonstrate, that they are things that need to be thought about in the future. 

    - One of the sub-topics might be this:

        - __Object Algebra__

            - Object algebra is the concept of being able to math with the code, because the systematics of interconnections between objects might be as straightforward that it can be turned into a form of mathematics.

- ### Attributes as Tree Layers

    - When data that is not a tree, it may still be converted to a tree, when maybe selecting a *property* (or *attribute*), and would choose to make the attribute values the nodes in the tree layer. That way multiple attributes might be selected which is could form a subsequent layer in the tree. Like that an arbitrary tree structure might be chosen from otherwise 'flat' data.

- ### [Automatic Object Formation](automatic-object-formation.md)

    - This is also a concept, that is considered to go too far for now. It is about automatically converting unorganized code and data into well-structured code and data, organizing it into objects, so that even when you would program something in an unstructured way, it can be automatically converted into a sound structure. This would be handy for trying to understand crap-code, or for reverse engineering compiled machine instructions, or to detect possible improvements to the structure of your code, maybe for deciphering the workings of a formed neural network. Maybe in the future you will not program in a structured way yourself anymore, but you just let the computer figure out the best way to structure the system. All in all, this goes too far for now, but it is something that needs to be thought through in the future.

- ### [Extensive Classification with Interfaces](extensive-classification-with-interfaces.md)
    
    - Extensive classification with interfaces might encompass some ideas about how to use interfaces more where otherwise you might not, so that a more detailed classification of things might emerge. This might be interesting to form some sort of semantic model. Mutuality of commands automatically leading to mutuality of interfaces might be a simpler example of an application of such an idea. Or a grouping based on what a dependent object uses. The idea might be played with, but might not be fully worked out yet.

- ### [Multiple Language Layers](multiple-language-layers.md)

    - Multiple language layers may be the idea that programming language could be built up of layers, first starting perhaps with *arithmetic* algebra and numbers (`+ - * /`). Arithmetic expressions may be input of *comparative* algebra (`< > =`). Then building up to *logical* operations (`and` / `or` / `not`). Then may follow *execution flow* (`if` / `else` / `then`). Constructs consisting of all of those operations may be organized into *procedures*. Those may be grouped into *objects*. Objects may have *relations* with each other. And what layer follows above that? *Aspects?* *Generated* code? From this idea might once follow a nice story. The document may just contain some loose ideas for now.
    
- ### [Text Classing](text-classing.md)

    - This concept might allow quickly selecting pieces of text out of a text document and call it an object and assign a class typing to it, so that you turn the text document into objects with classes, references to each other and a containment structure. That way text document might be turned into a relational structure perhaps in a practical way. The documentation tries to describes the basic idea.
