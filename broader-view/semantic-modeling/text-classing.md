Classification of items in a (Word) document.

This concept might allow quickly selecting pieces of text out of a text document and call it an object and assign a class typing to it, so that you turn the text document into objects with classes, references to each other and a containment structure. That way text document might be turned into a relational structure perhaps in a practical way.

By merely classifying pieces of text in a Word document, you might turn it into a database in no time. You might easily make relations between classes in that word document too, by connecting items. Actually, it’s adding relations between items, but by relating an item of one class to an item of the other class, you’re actually making a relation between two classes. However, that adds a column or at least a lot of space to the storage of a class. Maybe it should be possible for the related item to be able to be of any class. Maybe it’s just an ℓ => *n*, where ℓ stands for little.
