## Procedural Imposed On Algebraic

The criteria that are simple types can only be expressed with numbers and all. So simple literals. I accept that.  
I already had it clear in my head that the ‘source code’ not only expresses the static structure of the system, but can also hold data in it already.  
I accept the incorporation of a number notation.  
You can actually recognize how another language is incorporated in procedural: algebraic, being mainly numeric algebra, comparison algebra and logical algebra.  
That way you can see multiple paradigms imposed on each other:

- Relational
- Object oriented
- Procedural
- Algebraic
- Names

This is not adequate to provide a Symbol notation that incorporates Creator relations.
