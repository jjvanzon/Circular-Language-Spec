## Side-Issues

In previous projects the main articles about black boxing were finished, but other subjects were left unfinished. This article contains the unfinished material of some of these topics.

This article contains texts and loose ideas about the following topics:

- *Black Boxing and User Access Control*
    
    - Covers how simple black boxing could be made parallel to user access control.

- *Programmers and Users*

    - Addresses mainly the issue why when something is private, programmers get to change everything anyway, no matter how private or inaccessible things are. And why do users not get that privilege and what stops them from getting that privilege.

As said, the texts about these subjects are not finished yet.

### Black Boxing and User Access Control

Access control might be fully managed by the access control module, even for access controlling an object's members, making the members only accessible to the direct container of the member in order to hide complexity from the outside, or to to protect the object's data.

But that form of access control is so important in programming software, that it is introduced earlier as the concept of Public & Private, before access control is worked out as a complete solution to security.

Maybe access controllers are a step into the direction of security. Maybe security should be a kind of advanced access control.

Interesting idea for user access control: a constant in a program is a variable that can be changed by a programmer, but not by a user and also not by the program itself.

Public & Private,  
± 2008-09

This project should be the working out of the concept of Public & Private, even before it is integrated into the complete Access Control concept.

Public & Private need a preliminary notation, and preliminary explanation, so that the concept can be used in explanations of coding concepts wherever required.

Access Controlling System Aspects:  
Save for user access control, because this is about different roles:

- You can have friends for reading, writing
- or changing (add and delete symbols.)

### Programmers and Users

black boxes = user access control?

private contents visible in friends, and in definitions when you have user access to it, so you are a programmer, not a user.

Something like that...

Editing definition:

- \> 2009-06-30 Some of the ideas here are wrong, but the general idea should be thought of about editing the definition.
- Friend access is different from access to private contents
only when editing the definition.
    - \> 2009-06-26: No. this is user access control. Some users are authors of a definition. Some are not. Do not confuse it with private/public concepts.
- It's the difference between friend for reference, and friend for change.
    - \> 2009-06-26: Meh, see last comments.

If you are a friend for change (not for reference) for private contents, you might only see the private contents if you are at logical target the definition.

Set and Copy are used to set up lines. Lines are set up at design time, but can also be changed at run time. Sometimes you want to set a line at design time without being able to change it at run time. Therefore, Set and Copy might be able to have different access controllers at design time and run time. Just like the Get purposes can have different access controllers, it’s possible to have different access controllers for Design Time Set and Run Time Set and for Design Time Copy and Run Time Copy. Something is a constant if it can be Design Time Set, but not Run Time Set.

Object symbol system commands and purposes:

- Symbol
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time)
- Object
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Redirection
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- Type
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Redirection
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- Interface
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Redirection
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- State
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time)
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- Target Object
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Access
- Target Type
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Access
- Target Interface
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time)

Command symbol system commands and purposes:

- Symbol
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time)
- Call
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time)
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- Reference
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Redirect
    - Set : Run Time or Design Time
- Target Command:
    - Get : Copy (Run Time or Design Time) or Access
