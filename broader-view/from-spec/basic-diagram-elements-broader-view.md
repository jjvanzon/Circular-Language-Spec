## Introduction

For some reason the choices for the different shapes is sometimes commented on too.

## Circles & Triangles

The choice for having a circle depict an object, might relate to the view that objects could be considered the foundation for object oriented programming, and circles may arguably the most basic shape there is. So the most basic shape might then be used for the most basic concept.

## Squares & Diamonds

The choice for a square may happened, while finding the second most basic shape apart from the circle, trying to represent possibly the second-most basic concept of object oriented programming: commands. The diamond came out of the desire for a shape related to squares. Somehow there is the idea, that it might look like an 'activated' square in a way.

## Pentagons

The pointiness might be to distinguish it from other shapes, which may help visually perhaps. It sort of looks like a house maybe.

## Nonagon

`The* reason this` shape `is` used, to `express` a related list, `is because*` it `has many` corners, `symbolizing` a `multitude*`. It `is also*` like circles `might` fit in between `the*` pointy corners. This way it seems to be `the*` inversion of a circle: `the* opposite*` of a `singular*` object.

The idea is that the pointy parts stand for multiplicity. The exaggerated pointiness might be to distinguish it from other shapes. It also might sort of make it look like the inverse of a circle: a circle might stand for *one*, while an inverted circle may depict the idea of *many*.

Thoughts while looking for shapes to symbolize things might have been: As shapes become bigger, it may not be easy to distinguish hexagons, septagons, octagons and nonagons. Less than nine corners, may lead to shapes that intuitively may symbolize something else: Hexagons: Do bees have anything to do with it? Septagons: Maybe easily confused with pentagons? Octagons: A stop sign? should I stop?

## Wavy Line

As we might be running out of different ways to draw lines, this wiggling of the line may symbolize heat or energy. Values might regularly flow from one place to the next. So a symbolization of something active like waviness seemed appropriate.

## Access Marks

You can see the line dissector or access mark as the door that lets you access a symbol.

## Line Direction

The line direction rules are invented to as little as possible disturb the diagram with access symbols.

Common situations might not require an access symbol to determine the direction. These suggestions could be related to what direction is more common.

More suggestions than the ones in Basic Diagram Elements existed in the past, but they might have made things more complicated.

## Object Reference

You can see __A__ as being __B__’s *eye* to __C__, so it is logically directed outwards.
