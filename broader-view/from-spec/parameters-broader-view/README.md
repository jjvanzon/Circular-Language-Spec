Parameters-related topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then ideas perhaps more philosophical and lesser to the point.

- [Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled](commands-and-classes-loosely-coupled.md)

    - Objects of the same class might have a similar set of commands. But one particular idea for commands might be, that they might live as separate entities, not part of a specific class. The general idea might then be, that a command might automatically be available inside a class, if one of its parameters matches with that class.

    - This idea is let go of for now, because it seemed optional and hard to match with other ideas like encapsulation and containment structure.

- [Relations Between Commands & Objects](relations-between-commands-and-objects.md)

    - Perhaps rather similar to the previous topic.
