Circular Language Broader View | Expression
===========================================

`[ Draft ]`

This part of the documentation may cover remaining topics about diagram expression.  

The idea behind expression in general is that a program’s systematics might not be described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation may be mere *expressions* of systematics, stored in some other way, for instance a binary way as interlinked objects. The stored systematics might be translated to a diagram. The diagram might be edited, resulting in changes to the stored (binary) objects again.

This folder tries to cover the different kinds of ways you can express systematics. Perhaps in a broader sense than just Circular language alone.

Some of the documentation in this folder are mere throw-togethers of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.

The *Expression* folder may contain the following articles:

- ## [Alternative Media](alternative-media.md)

    - Text code and diagram expression might be complemented by any other form of expression. Systematics might be expressed in all sorts of alternative ways, such as windows user interfaces, data grids, pie charts, tree controls. It may be relevant to denote, that systematics might also be expressed in all these alternative media. All expressions might be considered alternative expressions of systematics, just like text code and diagram code.

    - The documentation of *Alternative Media* might not be finished up yet. It may consist of only one article, that may not be much more than a throw-together of ideas. Part of it might be texts coming out of an earlier unfinished design of the diagram notation language.

- ## [Expression Mixing](expression-mixing.md)

    - Furthermore all those forms of expression of systematics may be mixed and combined with each other. You might use text (code) inside diagrams and you may let an object in a diagram be opened in a window with a tree control in it and have the window be displayed on top of the diagram. Or a scroll bar or slider could be displayed next to an object in a diagram with which you can the object’s value. As such, all forms of expression might be embedded into each other.

    - The documentation might not have begun yet. There might only be a text with some loose ideas in it.

- ## [Specialized Expressions](specialized-expression.md)

    - Next to ways to express *any* set of interlinked objects, such as text code, diagrams and tree controls, there might also be expressions, that apply to specific *types* of objects. Documents such as pages with text and video files might be opened in the appropriate view. A sound object could be expressed by playing the sound. As such there could be user interfaces for specific object types: *Specialized Expressions*.

    - There may hardly be anything there inside the document. Specialized expressions might been present inside software forever, but the clear idea of placing it in the context of generally usable expressions and the distinction between generally usable expression and specialized expression might be newer.
