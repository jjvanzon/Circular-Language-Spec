## Loose Ideas

### Out of the original Symbol documentation

#### Programming Language

A computer program is described in a *programming language*. Formerly all programming languages were textual, just like normal language. The text that describes a program is called the program’s *code*. Symbol code consists mainly of *diagrams*, though. Nevertheless, the diagrams are called *code* all the same.

#### Symbol

Symbol Language comes in two main variations: text code and diagram code. Both variations can fully express a system. Sometimes a system looks clearer in a diagram and in other cases it looks clearer in text. The *Sigma Data Language* is also integrated into Symbol Language, as well as others.

One great aspect of diagram code is that apart from expressing a system in full, you can also have an abstract view on the system, leaving out details or highlighting specific details. This way the code itself can function as the analysis of it.
