Circular Language Broader View | Exchangeability | Clear Cut Coding Principles
============================================================

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

The idea behind clear cut coding principles, is that Circular might be so accessible, that anyone might pick it up, perhaps even children, because the principles might be easier to understand, and there might not be as many pitfalls.  
But I think only part of this is true. I think the basic parts of the coding principles might be more understandable, so perhaps children can create something useful with it, but more advanced subjects might be left out when giving a simpler view on it, because not all of it might be understood that easily.

Maybe the following topics could be used by children:

- Objects
- Relations
- Multiplicity
- Attributes
- Methods
- Input & Output

But perhaps not things like:

- Concepts
- Type Safety
- Locking

But some advanced features might be turned on, without being conscious of how it exactly works. For instance: automatic containment might be applied automatically, without needing to know exactly how it works.
