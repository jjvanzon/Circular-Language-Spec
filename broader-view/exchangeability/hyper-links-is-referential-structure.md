Circular Language Broader View | Exchangeability | Hyperlinks = Referential Structure
=====================================================================================

`[ Draft ]`

Hyperlinks are usually spread around a document. Currently, you can only view hyperlinks for one page at a time, and even for one document they are not neatly listed out, but spread all around the document.

I want to make document structures and hyperlinks analogous to objects and referential structures.

To be able to view the world wide web as a set of interlinked objects, you might see the hyperlinks in a web page, as references to other objects.

What you could do is list out the hyperlinks in a document as a series of references to other objects. Hyperlinks might become references to sub-objects. That way, web pages linking to each other can be seen as a referential structure. Then you can display the hyperlinks between multiple pages as a tree structure of related items or even in a diagram.

With the concept of automatic containment, you can also determine which parts of the world wide web can be seen as a bigger whole, containing smaller objects, and which parts of the world wide web could be seen as objects that are more independent from each other.

This idea is all about making the linkage in the world wide web integrate with the concept of objects linking together. I could display the linkage of the world wide web in the same kind of diagram as all the other digital objects.
