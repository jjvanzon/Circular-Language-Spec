User = Programmer
-----------------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

There is no distinction between design time and run time anymore. This makes programming software and using software blend together. 

Programs can indeed be displayed as text code, but also as diagrams or as objects linked together in a tree, more like a user interface. Perhaps not everything will be easy to understand to any type of user, but the lines between creating a programing and using a program will fade.

In essence, there is no distinction between creating a program and using a program. In both cases, you are simply using your computer: creating objects and altering their contents.

Using and altering a program at the same time can be done through the diagrams in which programs can be expressed. The diagrams will not be easy to understand by everybody. But for the more curious user it may be a view on the digital world, that allows them to see everything and change everything. I also think that younger people may adapt more easily to the diagrammatic view on computers’ contents.

Some users may find it difficult to use the functions that alter the behavior of a program, others may really appreciate it.

When you make a program for others to use, you don’t want the users to change the behavior of the program. In theory, users could change any part of the program, while they are using it. That’s where access control comes in. In practice, everything you make, is only accessible to you. Then you start selecting parts to make accessible to others. The parts that define the behavior of the program are not accessible to others. Only the part that makes up the usage of the program will be made accessible to others.

### Loose Ideas

The contents of an object might be arbitrary. Anything might be put inside an object. This might be handy for users, who just want to group objects together into a parent object, `like*` you might group together files in a folder.
