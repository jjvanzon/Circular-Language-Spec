Circular Language Broader View | Exchangeability | Programming Language = Database

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

This fundamental principle is about the fact that the code of a program is stored as a database. All the instructions of a program are stored as relational data, that is loaded by an engine and run. Any calculation, comparison or decision is an *object* which links to its parameters and the outcome is a resultant object too. All the correlations between things, that the program might are simply relational. There is no flat pieces of text code or flat pieces of binary machine code: it is an object structure, that describes for instance a method’s functioning. The program is stored as descriptive data that tells what a program might. It is this data that is loaded into an engine and run. This data itself is the executable program.
