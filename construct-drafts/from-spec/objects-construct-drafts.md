Object Reference
----------------

`<< terminology >>`  
Such an object reference may also be called a *pointer*.

Nothing
-------

`<< terminology>>`  
An object reference may then be *Nothing* or *null*.

`<< detail >>`  
Shapes *other* than circles might also be given a cross drawn inside it, to indicate it is empty.

Multiplicity
------------

`<< terminology >>`  
A single related object might hold a reference to one object. But the reference may not be filled in yet. Then it might point to no object at all. Therefore, it may be said that it might have a multiplicity of between 0 and 1. But for short it could be called multiplicity 1.
A list may contain zero or more objects. In that case the multiplicity might be between 0 and n. For short it may be called just n.
