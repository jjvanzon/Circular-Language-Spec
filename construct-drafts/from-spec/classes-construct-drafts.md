## Shape Both Dashed and Solid

It may be an idea that if a symbol serves as another objectâ€™s class, but also might be referenced like an object, the symbol might get a double border to maybe indicate its dual role as both an object and a class.

<img src="images/Classes.017.png" width="200" />

But there might be different ideas about this. The top reference in the previous picture seems to be a reference to a class, so it might be replaced by a dashed circle:

<img src="images/Classes.018.png" width="200" />

But perhaps the doubly bordered shape on the right might appropriately be be drawn with a dashed border after all, since its role seems to be a class.

<img src="images/Classes.019.png" width="200" />

Then it looks like it might make sense to draw the double-bordered shape with just a dashed border.

The optional nature of the dashed shapes seems to leave things open to discussion.

## Dashed Shape

`<< repeated >>`

When a shape is used as a *class*, it might be drawn with a *dashed* border.
In *Circular* a class may also be referenced as an *object*.

<img src="images/Classes.019.png" width="200" />

Drawing a shape with a dashed border, might be optional though.
