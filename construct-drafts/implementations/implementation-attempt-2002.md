## Introduction

J Code is the compiler of the Sigma operating system. It converts one type of code to another.

There is a standard way to describe a programmatic system: the system document, which is a system specification document. You specify a system object orientedly.

The main language of Sigma can be said to be Symbol code. Symbol code is a diagrammatic representation of the system specification document. When speaking of Symbol code I may be speaking of the diagrams, but I can also be speaking of a system document.

Symbol code can be compiled to Sigma module machine code.

J Code and J Core are basically the same project.  
This project involves the following:

- J Core
    - All of J Core
    - Sigma module
- Language Definition
    - Symbol language
    - Symbol document
- Translation
    - Symbol to Sigma
    - Parsing
    - Symbol to Text
    - Text to Symbol 
    - Basic to Symbol
    - C++ to Symbol
    - Symbol to Basic
    - Symbol to C++
    - __*Optimization*__
        - Procedural optimization
        - Machine code optimization
- Symbol View and Interaction

Each subject has its own document. This document only describes the subjects in general.

## Symbol Database

Symbol language is stored in a J Database.

### Old

### System Specification

The symbol language includes a system specification document class. This class might be used to contain the source code. The document is read to be able to produce the Sigma module.

### Document

The document is encapsulated by a single class that represents the part of the software through which the Symbol code data is managed and in which it is stored and guarded. Calling the members of its interface might not harm the integrity of the Symbol diagram.

The document returns the diagram data, provides edit methods, manages selections, allows undo, etc. Almost all possibilities for the user of the Symbol Environment have a place in the symbol document.

#### Copy and Paste

(and Cut, Save Selected and Merge)

Cutting is the same as Copying and then Deleting. Saving Selected might work the same as Copying. Merging might work the same as Pasting. This narrows it down to Copy and Paste.  I might explaining Copy and Paste in detail.

No diagram might have classes, references or parents that do not exist in the same diagram. If a fraction of a diagram is taken when copying and classes of objects in the fraction are not in the fraction then dummy classes might be added and taken in use. The same goes for parents and references.

An effect of that is that cutting and then immediately pasting might not keep the situation in tact. Classes that weren't cut are no longer referred to by the cut and pasted symbols, but they might have a dummy as a class.

Only the outer parent might not be dummied. There might be –1 parents in the fraction, which might become the parent the fraction is pasted in.

Just about the only difference between Copy/Paste and SaveSelected/Merge is that SaveSelected/Merge has to use a whole SymDoc as a 'clipboard', while Copy/Paste can do with only a SymDocTable which excludes indexes, selections and many other things.

##### Paste

Usually paste comes after copy, but it's easier to understand in this case. The clipboard contains a valid diagram. When pasting you first add to the main diagram all the symbols in the clipboard with all their properties except parent, reference and class. Mind that adding a symbol doesn't mean that the new symbol is at the end of the line.  the new symbol could be anywhere in the table. While adding all those symbols from the clipboard to the main diagram you build an array that contains the positions of all the newly added symbols. This same array serves as a conversion from the clipboard diagram symbol positions to the new main diagram symbol positions.  
( all the classes, referees and parents are there now safe to be referred to if you convert the clipboard positions to main diagram positions )  
You know *which* of the diagram symbols were just added because we built up an array saying which ones were added. Then you change the parent, reference and class properties of the added symbols not to what's in the clipboard, but to what's in the clipboard converted to positions in the main diagram.

##### Copy

In every SymDocTable there is an extra field 'Vector' that serves as a vector table.  
A secondary SymDoc or a SymDocMain might function as a clipboard. You add as many symbols to the clipboard as should be copied and set all properties except Parent, Reference and Class. As you do that you fill in the vector table in the main diagram: diagram position -> clipboard position which means that you don't change ALL the entries in the vector table.  
After all symbols have been added to the clipboard you might change the parents, references and classes in the clipboard to the value in the primary doc converted with the vector table so they become references to positions in the clipboard and not position in the diagram. If a class wasn't copied then the vector table indicates -1 for it and then an extra symbol is to be added to the clipboard representing a dummy class and an the entry in the vector table that converts the not copied class might convert it to the dummy class. Positions of these vectors to dummy classes are kept in an array. Then the process of changing parents, references and classes can continue. Of course when I talk about a class the same goes for parents and references. After copying, the vector table should be reset. All the selected symbols' Vector properties are to be set to -1.  
We kept an array of positions of vectors to dummy classes these vectors should be reset to -1 also.

The residence of the vector table is best in the main symbol table for it might be costly to create an array with 60,000 records every time you copy any small bit of a 60,000 symbol diagram.

#### The below information about Document is obsolete

In this section I might describe abstractly three things about the document: what is explicitly stored (“Stored”), what is read only and what is random access (“Properties”) and the methods of the document class (“Methods”).

Keywords regarding the document are: integrity, indexes and abundance.

#### Stored

The document __*explicitly stores*__:

Main data: 

- Symbols
- Name()
- Public()
- Type()
- In()
- To()
- Of()
<br/><br/>
- Symbols is the number of symbols.
- Name contains the names of these symbols.
- Public contains whether a symbol is public or not.
- Type contains the type of which a symbol is. That can be a circle, a triangle, a square or invalid.
- ‘In’ contains for each symbol a pointer to the symbol the symbol is inside. Thus this is the main data of the encapsulation structure of a system.
- ‘To’ contains for each symbol a pointer to the symbol this symbol refers to. Thus this is the main data for the delegation/reference/call structure of a system.
- ‘Of ‘contains for each symbol a pointer to the symbol that is the descendant class of this symbol. Thus this is the main data of the inheritance structure of a system.

Indexes:

- ValidSymbols
- ValidSymbol() 
<br/><br/>
- SymbolsInMe()
- InMe(,)
- SymbolsToMe()
- ToMe(,)
- SymbolsOfMe()
- OfMe(,) 
<br/><br/>
- ValidSymbols is the number of valid symbols.
- ValidSymbol is an enumeration of pointers to all valid symbols.
- SymbolsInMe is the number of contained symbols for each symbol.
- InMe is an enumeration of pointers pointing to all contained symbols.
- SymbolsToMe is for each symbol the number of symbols referring to that symbol.
- ToMe is an enumeration of pointers pointing to all symbols referring to the a symbol.
- SymbolsOfMe is the number of descendants for each symbol.
- OfMe is an enumeration of the ancestors of a symbol.

Cursors:

- SymbolCursor
- SymbolInMeCursor()
- SymbolToMeCursor()
- SymbolOfMeCursor()
<br/><br/>
- SymbolCursor returns the symbol currently worked with. That means which symbol in the main data we are taking actions upon.
- SymbolInMeCursor returns the position we’re currently at in the enumeration of contained symbols of the symbol at SymbolCursor.
- SymbolToMeCursor returns the position we’re currently at in the enumeration of symbols that refer to the symbol at SymbolCursor.
- SymbolOfMeCursor returns the position we’re currently at in the enumeration of the ancestors of the symbol at SymbolCursor.

#### Properties

All of the members mentioned in “Stored” are properties. Some of the properties though are read only outside current scope, others are random access and others need to be altered using methods. That is what is explained in this section.

#### Methods

There are methods that can return to you object relational information and there are the main methods with which to manipulate the diagram. The object relation information simply derive their return values from the stored data. The main data manipulation methods are the guards of the diagram data. They put restrictions on data manipulation that guard the data’s integrity.

### Brainstorm

#### System Specification

The symbol language includes a system specification document class. This class might be used to contain the source code. The document is read to be able to produce the Sigma module.

## Optimizations

### Boolean Algebraic

Everything should eventually lead to storage.  
What is storage?  
If you take storage out of the code then do you have like one large boolean expression?

I don’t know.

It just worries me that If is a boolean operator

```
If x = 43 then 3
```

## Symbol to Symbol: Collapse Object Structure, Reduce to Commands

This translation can be explained without knowing the Sigma module structure. This translation is a step in translating Symbol to Sigma, but the rest of Symbol to Sigma translation can only be explained if Sigma module structure is explained.

### Symbol to Sigma

A Sigma module contains the organization of a module as well as the machine instructions of the module. The organization is a tree like groupage. To get the tree like structure you tie together tables by referring to another table inside one table. To create consecutive memory out of the table structure you simply string up all the tables including their references to each other. References are the memory addresses starting at the address of the beginning of the module. The tables include the eventual machine code which is right inside the organization data.

Sigma requires you to obey a certain groupage. Sigma doesn’t require you to put the tables in a fixed order in memory. It only requires you to tie the right table to the right other table. This makes the hierarchy adequately in order.

In the future I might change the code organization, but I might now take the following as an example organization:

... (encapsulation diagram of the organization)

To get the memory that is the Sigma module you can stack up the organization recursively. You can also stack up the organization level by level. When generating the Sigma module it proves to be easier to stack it up recursively.

The module is now in an organization that J Core can work with and it can run the containing machine code with multiple threads and create memory objects from the memory object layouts. Other modules can quite easily work with the module.

That’s what J Core basically might: run machine code in multiple threads and create memory objects. If you correctly organize an module then J Core can work with it.

J Core sets some rules on how to organize the modules. It doesn’t create the modules itself. It only sets the rules.

J Code executes the rules by creating correct J Core modules.

So J Core’s task is to work correctly with a code organization. J Code’s task is to create the code organization according to the rules.

#### Symbol Tables

Outline compiled modules can be programmed with. However, there are no names for the module itself, its classes, interfaces, members and arguments. Those entities only have numbers, because numbers are faster to work with. To be able to program with the modules you might have the names. As a human being you simply can’t work with the numbers. Symbol tables can be generated during compilation that tie names to the module, all its classes and interfaces and members and arguments. These symbol tables are only used when programming with the modules. When your program runs then the symbol tables aren’t used, but the numbers.

## Controls

### View

The Symbol view might simply be the drawn diagram. Complex calculation is involved with placing the symbols on screen, because the user might not use the mouse to place the symbols on screen. The symbols are automatically positioned. The complex calculation is the most complicated about the view, but for calculations there is referred to another section “Calculation” so that won’t be in this chapter. What I’ll describe is the other features that the view supports.

The view supports Zoom and Offset by mouse movement. It supports a map for an overview of the symbols. It can display grids and rulers. It can use color indicators to let jump symbols matching certain criteria. Coloring is also commonly used to display inheritance relations. 

#### Building the Mesh

The mesh is built up from the outside inwards. There is always the first single circle: 0. The inner circles need to be laid out over a circle with a radius half the size of the parent.

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.001.png)

The the radius of the inner circles depend on the amount of inner circles. If you draw out an n-gon connecting the centers of the inner circles together, then the radii of the inner circles are a third of the length of the n-gon’s sides. (See “Calculations N-Gon”)

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.002.png "Calculation Mesh Lined Up Children")

The n-gon formula is:

```
Cos ½ (Pi – (2Pi / n)) = (½ l) / r
```

So:

```
Cos ½ (Pi –  (2Pi / Children)) = (½l) / (Rchild / 2)
l = 2 * (Rchild / 2) * Cos ½ (Pi – (2Pi / Children)))
```

So the the radius for a child is:

```
1/3l = (2 / 3) * (Rchild / 2) * Cos ½ (Pi – (2Pi / Children)))
```

### Interaction

The interaction isn’t much more than two text boxes and something that interprets typed single word or two word commands and then calling the appropriate function of the document. Restrictions are managed by the document so the interaction might not concern itself with protecting the data.

### Calculation

#### Pythagoras

#### N-Gon

This section covers the calculation of equal sided n-gons’ coordinates, sides and radii. This calculation is part of the JMath library and is encapsulated by the class NGon.

Without pictures the facts are as follows:

```
l = 2r * cos ½ (PI – 2PI / n)
r = l / (2 * cos ½ (PI – 2PI / n)
x = r * cos((2PI / n + b) * I)
y = r * sin((2PI / n + b) * I)
```

Fortunately I made pictures. Get ready for adult sesame street.

##### Radius to Side Length

I need the length

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.003.png)

Of the sides of an equal sided n-gon

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.004.png)

The describes a circle

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.005.png)

And all I have is the radius

![](images/Computer%20Language,%20Old%20Ideas.006.png)

Or rather:
- Got r
- Need l

I need the length of the sides of any equal sided n-gon that describes a circle with a defined radius

```
l = 2r  * Cos ½ (PI – 2PI / n)
```

##### Side Length to Radius

```
r = l / (2 * Cos ½ (PI – 2PI / n)
```

##### N and StartAngle To Coordinates

```
x = r * cos((2PI / n + b) * I)
y = r * sin((2PI / n + b) * I)
```

#### Vibration

...

## Brainstorm

### ‘Normal’ Variables

Variables are objects. A data type is a class. Its members operate on some data.  
Constants (can be assigned only once where declared (initialization))

Copy is like variable assignment

I might translate each common variable action for you to symbol object structure methods.

### Brainstorm

- Event interfaces
- Multiple sink events

### Darn

#### Symbol Tables

Outline compiled modules can be programmed with. However, there are no names for the module itself, its classes, interfaces, members and arguments. Those entities only have numbers, because numbers are faster to work with. To be able to program with the modules you might have the names. As a human being you simply can’t work with the numbers. Symbol tables can be generated during compilation that tie names to the module, all its classes and interfaces and members and arguments. These symbol tables are only used when programming with the modules. When your program runs then the symbol tables aren’t used, but the numbers.

##### New

The lowest advisable level to program J Core modules in is a Symbol document. This specifies the system structure. The commands are also specified in symbol. The symbols in a command can refer to the Symbol Assembly library or can refer to other commands inside the module or to commands outside the module. The commands can be displayed as a diagram, but also as a language much like Assembly language and OO Basic intermixed.

J Code might convert the symbol document into the tables specifying the classes and interfaces and translate the commands to Assembly code that makes J Core calls and obeys the extra set of rules that J Core sets that you might not worry about as a programmer.

Management of segments, optimizing code for speed, etcetera, are all controlled by J Code and I don’t want programmers, including me, to have anything to do with it, because it is possible to automatically do this. I think real assembly is not worth manually programming with and should be automated.

-----

Keep believing in Symbol.

Again I am analyzing something I wrote for a complex problem (a problem that others made complex for me), and again I wish to know what calls what, how many times something is called and where. When I'd have a symbol view of the code then I'd instantly see everything.

### Usage of J Data

Storage lists in Symbol should be able to be standard arrays.

Shouldn’t I create my own simple array class? Yep, it won’t work under Microsoft, but at least the code is structure in accordance with Sigma... or something.  
Oh, huh? How can I create an array without a base data structure for it? Huh?

```vb
Array1 = New Array(Integer)
Array1.Items
Array1(3)
```

-----

Operation is actually a nice synonym for a function, procedure, subroutine, routine, etcetera.

### J Code

I might think about and write something about the fact that most properties that can be written are hardly ever read.

For clarity, there are cases in which common parameters of members are best included in each member, but there are also cases in which common parameters of members can best become members of their own. For instance in set of members with a lot of parameters that have the same values a lot. If the values of the common parameters are the same most of the time, they are best made members of their own.

If the values of the parameters are different all the time, it's best to keep them as parameters.

This is the contemplation for clarity, which is something different from the contemplation for efficiency. I wonder if the stack (with random access) is really faster than regular memory access. That's the criterium for efficiency contemplations.

#### J Code and Code Style

Je moet om properties te groeperen in Vb een hele set klassen maken.

Eigenlijk zou alle logische genitiviteit gegroepeerd moeten worden, zonder dat je er een klasse van hoeft te maken. Maar in Symbol maak je er al gemakkelijk gewoon een klasse van. Het groepering symbool doet dat eigenlijk al. Anyway, als je een Button List hebt, dan moet je per button iets instellen Button (aIndex) . Visible bijvoorbeeld. Je kunt een klasse maken van Button List zijn Button. En dan een array van die klassen maken. Maar kan je niet gewoon Button (aIndex) . Visible als property van de Button List declareren? Hmmm... Bij de wee, ik moet naamgeving uitleggen ergens. Ik heb bij de wee iets veranderd aan mijn naamgeving. In Button List, bijvoorbeeld, had ik ooit een Button Visible (aButton As Long) As Boolean, maar ook een Button Width As Double. Maar die laatste was hetzelfde voor alle buttons, dus niet een Button z’n width, maar de Buttons hun width. Buttons Width dus, niet Button Width. Gepuncteerd:  
Button (aButton) . Visible  en  Buttons . Width. Dit voorkomt dubbelzinnigheid. Some is het ook zo dat je een opeenvolging van namen als identifier hebt: Group Supplier Type References. In dat geval is het 1 Group Supplier Type’s References, want de laatste naam is het lijdend voorwerp. Als het om een Group Supplier zijn Type References gaat, dan weet ik even nog niet exact de naamgeving, alleen dat het anders moet zijn. Group Supplier Types References? Omdat het om al de Types van een Group Supplier gaat? Maat een Type Reference was in die database 1 entity geworden, dus om nu verstoring in die naam aan te brengen... Het is een Group Supplier’s Type References, maar... hmmm logisch gezien is ‘Types References’ wel goed.

Meervouden kunnen by de wee dus verzamelingen aangeven, maar ook een aantal.

Het gaat dus om het genitief stapelen van namen en het juiste gebruik van enkelvouden en meervouden.

En ook 0 based tellen, maar wel aritmetische aantallen.

Misschien nog wat over het vermijden van loops.

-----

Sometimes there’s a distinction between a class that serves as a simple storage for, let’s say Object Interfaces, and a class that combines other classes ondergeschikt aan Object Interfaces and the storage class I mentioned. In both cases you could use a plural to denote you manage a collection of Object Interfaces. To distinct the storage list from the complexer abstraction class you call the storage class Object Interface List class, while the complexer abstraction class you call the Object Interfaces class

If you use constructions like described in the last paragraph, then if a class is an abstract of a basic data structure storage, but the entities involved have no child entities for the storage to be combined with, then the class doesn’t might be called a list, because it manages everything up until this abstraction level... < I need a better description for that, man >

-----

List of objects: Object List. No plural used. It could mean Object’s list, so it should actually be Objects List. Hmmm... It don’t sound too great, but...

A data abstracting class should be named after its main dimension / main entities / target entity. < In an index, the source entity should be mentioned too. >

I took back using a plural to identify a collection. I can’t tell amounts and collections apart that way and code became unreadable to me.

I also called both storage classes and combining classes ‘lists’ now. 

Properties vs. parameters. Consider named properties. Make a deep comparison of properties and parameters. I still don't know the speed of the stack compared to a normal memory address.

To get an object (property) structure nicer, so that entities are actually objects and not just properties with a common prefix, you can do the following:

You create a class maintaining the storage structures of the entities combined. Then you create another class that refers to this storage class, but actually represents only one row in it. Then you can use this class as the type of a property of another class and this property has nice member access to the object. I actually think this refinement of my general structuring is very required. Only then do the interfaces look as what they represent. 

This way the following:

```
ModuleInterfaceModuleInterfaceMemberType(4, 2, 3, 21)
```

becomes:

```
Module(4).InterfaceModule(2).Interface(3).Member(21).Type
```

or in Symbol:

```
Module Interface Module Interface MemberType [4, 2, 3, 21]
```

Becomes:

```
Module [4] . Interface Module [2] . Interface [3] . Member [21] . Type
```

A much better representation of actuality, and readable, unlike the original structure.

Member access isn't only useful in, also to group things. To get member access to the grouped things you actually require another class, which is unfortunately not a child class in visual basic, but another entry in the richly occupied class list in Visual Basic. Might you have a thing as child classes, this ugliness could be omitted, because it might then be a tree structure. Another thing with grouping properties is that when you put them in a child class, the child class doesn't have access to the main class's members just like that. You might want the grouped properties to interact with the other properties. In that case you should might use another phenomena than just a child class. Something solely made for grouping. In VB you don't have this. For that, for interaction with the properties outside a class that groups a few can only be accessed if you give the group a reference to the parent class. This adds a method or property to the group that we don't want to see outside the main class. We can't verhelp this inside the module. But outside the module we don't need to see this member that sets the parent class. We can hide them from outside the module, by declaring them Friend, instead of Public. But inside the module we might still see it as part of the member of an object property.

#### Other

In the Windows API documentation somewhere it is told that delegating specific windows message handling to other functions in the window procedure might prevent the stack from overflowing when using many local variables.

However, if you make it so that the local variables are allocated on the stack imperatively where they are declared, when the declaration code isn’t reached, this allocation doesn’t take place. Microsoft people might advise (in documentation about VB) to put local variable declarations at the beginning of the procedure. So it may not be the best methodology that makes the argument for this. It’s may not be a good idea.

It may not be a good idea regarding the using a function a message. It is however so that variables on the stack aren’t freed until you exit the function, so you can’t free declared stack variables. Maybe I could free it in J Code if it might be required.

-----

Windows often stuffs a lot of booleans in a bit field. In the Windows Controls, often styles are used, which are booleans in bit fields that you can switch on or off. You supply the bit field at creation of the control window. You can change the bit field of some bits in the fields by sending window messages to the control.

I might just make them properties most of the times. At most I make them creation arguments. Supplying all as creation arguments is no better than not initializing the control and letting the programmer set the properties. Properties are not applied to the representation straight away, because display operations are postponed, because they do not affect control logic data and operations, yet cost CPU time.

What is better in the Windows way? If anything, can I embed it into my way, without losing any benefits of my way?

-----

Windows might stuff multiple values into a single data unit. For instance, a bunch of boolean properties into a single integer as a bit field. That is actually size efficient. Nevertheless if you want to change one value, it requires you to retrieve the original set of values, change one flag and then assign all values at once again while you only wanted to assign one of them. The situation gets worse when not just working with a bit field, but working with a structure that contains many properties that can only combinedly be retrieved and assigned. Then there isn’t really a space efficiency and the amount of data transported is larger and more ifs are involved and more code, because handling each individual value requires its own code anyway. All ‘overhead’ given by using separate values separately is that you have more callable functions, which is actually more a benefit than an overhead. The code handling the value assignments is there in both situations anyway.

-----

Consider making designers for certain things. If a designer might help.

-----

The simplest way to turn a variable into an expression is to enclose it in child-hesis.

-----

Tip: If you're going to use the value of a property more than once, your code might run faster if you store the value in a variable.

Conversely in symbol when a property returns explicitly a variable, then you compile it to be an access of the value.

-----

Each time the text changes in Text1, the child form's text box Change event sets boolDirty to True.

Not to have the setting of the variable execute all the time, you can make two commands one of which sets the variable, the other of which doesn’t. After the variable is set, the function pointer currently pointing to the function setting the variable is changed to pointing to the function not setting the variable.

Wow another kind of optimization

-----

- Nominative: object or member call
- Genitive: member access
- Dative: parameter
