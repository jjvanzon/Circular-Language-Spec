Multiple Language Layers
========================

- Arithmetic Algebra
- Comparative Algebra
- Boolean Algebra
- Execution Flow
- Procedural
- Object Oriented
- Relational
- …

##### Procedural Imposed On Algebraic

The criteria that are simple types can only be expressed with numbers and all. So simple literals. I accept that.

I already had it clear in my head that the ‘source code’ not only expresses the static structure of the system, but can also hold data in it already.

I accept the incorporation of a number notation.

You can actually recognize how another language is incorporated in procedural: algebraic, being mainly numeric algebra, comparison algebra and logical algebra.

That way you can see multiple paradigms imposed on eachother:
\- Relational

\- Object oriented

\- Procedural

\- Algebraic

\- Names

This is not adequate to provide a Symbol notation that incorporates Creator relations.
