Omitted Identifier in a Diagram
-------------------------------

It is not mandatory to name an element of the system.

Omitted identifiers are explained in the article *Omitted Identifier*. This article emphasizes its implication on diagram expression.

An element of the system can also function without an identifier, because the diagram has an individual symbol to point to. In that case the symbol can’t easily be expressed in text code, but it is possible for a symbol to live without an identifier.
