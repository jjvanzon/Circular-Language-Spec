Identifiers in a Diagram
------------------------

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

Identifiers are names for objects, collections, attributes, sites, programs, modules or any other element of a system. Any element of a system can get an identifier.

Identifiers are explained in the article *Identifiers*. This article demonstrates their usage in a diagram.

An identifier is placed just outside a shape’s border, usually just above it.
Any shape can get an identifier.

Identifiers are also put at the end of lines that direct out of the diagram, to identify the target of the line.
