Circular Language Construct Drafts | Text Code
==============================================

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

Omitted Identifier
------------------

Text code might not be leading in Circular. The connections between elements of a system are leading, and even the expression in a diagram is more leading than text code.

It is not mandatory to give an element of the system a name. An element of the system can also function without an identifier, because connections can be established even between unnamed system elements. In a diagram each system element has an individual symbol. It is possible for such a symbol to live without an identifier and you can make connections to the symbol even when it doesn’t have a name.
