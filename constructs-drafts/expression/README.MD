Expression
----------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

*Expression* might be about a *diagram notation* for visualizing the program code. The diagrams may be mere expressions of binary interlinked objects. Systematics, stored in a binary way as interlinked objects, might be translated to a diagram, expressed on screen. The diagram might once be fully automatically drawn out. The metrics and positioning of the shapes and lines may automatically determined. The diagram might be edited, resulting in changes to the stored binary objects.

This documentation folder might describe remaining topics about diagram the diagram notation, that might not quite have made it into the main texts.

The articles here might not be not finished. This folder may contain the following articles:

- ### [Misc Pictures](misc-pictures)

    - Some misc pictures that were somehow hard to throw away.

- ### [Abstract Diagram Expression](abstract-diagram-expression.md)

    - This article might not be finished. Abstract diagram expression might mean to use the diagram notation leaving all sorts of details out of the diagram, to only draw out the general concept of something. For instance, just drawing two triangles on paper might not be a real program yet, but it couple mean ‘separation between interfaces’. It might not express an actual system, but it may express the general concept of something. You can also draw out a diagram, that may clearly make a point about how a system works, while in practice the actual diagram code of the fully working program might not look that way. You might leave out all sorts of details for the sake of making a point. The diagram may even be formally incorrect, but still it would make a point. How you could use the diagram notation as such might be further worked out in an article.

- ### [Abusing Diagram Expression](abusing-diagram-expression.md)

    - This article is not finished yet. Diagrams might usually be drawn out in a standard way: each shape has its meaning, containment has a meaning, lines have a meaning, line types like dashed and dotted have their meaning. The concept of *abusing diagram expression* is about the idea of switching around these means of expression and their actual meanings. For instance: the referential structure of objects is expressed by putting shapes inside other shapes. To express which references inside the diagram point to the same object, lines are used connecting those shapes, that represent the same object. How would the diagram look if you could express the same-object thing with containment and the referential thing with lines between shapes? It is not fully worked out how this would work, but this is what *abusing diagram expression* may be about: switching means of expression between what they actually express. Another idea, that might also be called diagram expression abuse, is to allow shapes to overlap: in the 'normal' diagram notation shapes do not overlap, but abusing diagram expression might also cover how overlap in a system could be expressed in a diagram by actual overlap of shapes.

- ### Diagrams as a Concept

    - The idea behind diagrams as a concept, might be that drawing out diagrams may be implemented as a *concept* programming construct, which might use the reflective data of objects and translate that to a diagram.
