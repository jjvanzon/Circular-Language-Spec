Misc Pictures
-------------

This folder contains an archive file with pictures in it, that were somehow hard to throw away. Even though the documentation has quite a few diagram images, some of the ones in the archive are made while analyzing real programming situations. One of them was the very first of these diagrams I ever made. Others show an impression of how it would feel to operate a diagram in an actual application. It may be a reminder of what this is for.
