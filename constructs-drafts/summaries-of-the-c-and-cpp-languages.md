## Introduction

This document contains summaries of other languages (C and C++), in the form of bulleted lists. They were made around the year 2004 during an analysis of the grammar of C and C++ to compare them to Circular.

    - Declarators: specifies
        - The name and pointering in a declaration (and type names in certain cases). Basically the part of the declaration that the specifiers do not cover.
            - Name
            - Pointers: pointer, reference, array, pointer to any member of a type (ClassName`::*`)

Where did the embedded declarations in a function declaration go?

Other Software System components replace functionality of Standard libraries, but C programmers should be able to specify functions from them, shouldn’t they. Not gonna mind right now.

Formal arguments are the variables inside the function as opposed to the values given in the function call.

## Other

I don’t summarize Com, because it doesn’t really add any programming concepts, but mainly only libraries. I don’t summarize Visual Basic, because it doesn’t really add any concepts to... oh, I do need Visual Basic and Com, for the events and stuff... dang. And properties, and all. Many Visual Basic and Com concepts have no place in this programming language, but in other modules.

Com concepts: components, interfaces.
