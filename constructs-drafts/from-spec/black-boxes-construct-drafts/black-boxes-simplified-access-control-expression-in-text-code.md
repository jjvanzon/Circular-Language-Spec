## Main Idea

To describe the access control of a parameter using the literals, introduced in the article *Access Controlling System Aspects*, you end up with an access control literal, that is quite a mouthful, for instance:

```
Object Set Public
Value Get Private
Value Set Private
```

The inaccessible system commands were left out already, even though their inaccessibility is also part of the access control.

In a diagram each of those access control elements can be represented by a quite easy to read access connector. But in textual form they look like quite a mouthful. In other programming languages they look easier.

That is why access control literals should be simplified. This article lists out the rules for simplifying access control literals.

## Admission

I have tried to make a good setup of simplification rules, but I have not been able finish it. However, I do find it important to be picked up in the future, to make a clear set of terms, that more easily expresses access control situations. In this article I might lay out the ideas I already have about it, even though it is not finished yet.

## Leave out the inaccessible

The first rule was already covered: leave out anything that is not accessible at all. You only end up with the ways you *can* access it.

Here is the list again of access control elements, that can be used:

```
Object Get Private
Object Get Public
Object Set Private
Object Set Public
Class Get Private
Class Get Public
Class Set Private
Class Set Public
Value Get Private
Value Get Public
Value Set Private
Value Set Public
Clone X Get Private
Clone X Get Public
Clone X Set Private
Clone X Set Public
Data Get Private
Data Get Public
Data Set Private
Data Set Public
Execute Private 
Execute Public
New Private
New Public
Annul Private
Annul Public
( Command )
```

So only the accessible elements might end up in the access control literal.

## Aspects separated

The various system aspects might always produce their own separate piece of access control literal:

```
Value
Object
Class
Data
Execute
Creation ( New / Annul )
Command / Object
```

These elements, if accessible at all, always each produce a *separate* piece of access control literal, and no rules might be introduced, that converge access control elements of different aspects to a single term.

## Order in a basic literal

In the texts above you have already seen the order of the keywords inside a single access control element, for instance:

```
Object Get Public
```

The order is:

```
Aspect
Assignment direction
Access direction
```

So first one of the following:

```
Value
Data
Clone X
Object
Class
Execute
New
Annul
Command
```

Then one of the following:

```
Get
Set
```

And then one of the following:

```
Private
Public
```

Those three keywords form a single access control element, for instance:

```
Object Get Public
```

## Ordered by system aspects

The access control elements themselves are also ordered. First I proposed to always order them by system aspect:

```
Command
Value
Clone X
Data
Object
Class
Execute
Creation
```

The order was dependent on a general likeliness for a system aspect to be accessed. But this ordering might not be used anymore. The chronological order described below might be used.

## Chronological order

Another option for ordering the access control elements, is to order them by the most likely chronological order, which is:

```
Set Public
Get Private
Set Private
Get Public
```

This order completely replaces the ordering by system aspects. The access control elements for different system aspects could be intermixed, producing for instance the following access control literal:

```
Object Set Public, Value Set Private
```

## In, Out and Thru

The terms I might like to see back in access control literals are the terms __In__, __Out__ and __Thru__. It might greatly increase the readability if you could for instance say:

```
Object In, Value Out
```

Earlier on, this article introduced a way to use the terms __In__, __Out__ and __Thru__, that I later had to withdraw. It was implied, that In is writing from the outside, and Out is writing from the inside, so it implied, that it was about the access direction of *writing*. However, now I figure that it is whether the inner object writes or reads, so __In__ might mean reading from the inside and __Out__ might mean writing on the inside. How public reading and writing might be called from that perspective, is not clear to me yet (2008-09-29). I might further work out the terms In, Out and Thru in the *Advanced Command Articles*.

Also: it was implied that in __Object Set Public, Value Set Private__, you do not privately *get* the object, that was *set* publicly. But that was a mistake as well: you do first get the object privately in order to set it’s value. This all might be worked out in the *Advanced Command Articles*.

## Object Or Command

Whether a parameter is an object or a command, is not really access control over the parameter, but can be regarded part of the parameter *passing*, so it *is* involved here. 

The parameter access control literal starts with the keyword __Command__ when the parameter is a command. When the parameter is a normal object, the keyword __Command__ is left out.

For instance:

```
Command Class Set Public
```

Or 

```
Command Object Set Public, Execute Private
```

## Creation

By creation I mean the system commands __New__ and __Annul__. An object might be created or annulled from the outside or created and annulled from the inside. You already have a low-level way to express parameter access control for this:

```
New Private
New Public
Annul Private
Annul Public
```

but you may want to express it with less words.

Below are described three options for simplification of __New__ and __Annul__ access control literals:

- Implied by __Object__ aspect
- Use of keywords __In__, __Out__ and __Thru__
- Use of the keyword __Existence__

### Implied by Object aspect

__New__ and __Annul__ are also sort of like __Object__ aspect writing. So __Object Set Public__ may also mean you can publicly execute __New__ on the parameter, as well as __Annul__. So maybe __Object Set__ implies also that you can execute __New__ and __Annul__. __New__ and __Annul__ under the surface might probably use __Object Set__ anyway, and *above* the surface you may be able to use __Object Set__ as a __New__ and __Annul__ after all (but I am saying nothing final about that yet).

But perhaps you should not go with such implication and insist you always express it when you can use __New__ or __Annul__ on something.

### In, Out and Thru

Since __New__ and __Annul__ are both writing, you may use the terms __In__ and __Out__ for it.

__New In__ might mean you can execute __New__ from the outside and __New Out__ means you can execute __New__ on the inside. This produces the following, easier to interpret literals:

```
New In
New Out
Annul In
Annul Out
```

And when __New__ or __Annul__ are both accessible __In__ and __Out__:

```
New Thru
Annul Thru
```

### The Existence keyword

Perhaps the terms __New__ and __Annul__ could converge into a single term, when they are both accessible the same way, for instance to the keyword __Existence__:

```
Existence In
    = New In, Annul In
    = New Public, Annul Public
Existence Out
    = New Out, Annul Out
    = New Private, Annul Private
Existence Thru
    = Existence In, Existence Out
    = New In, Annul In, New Out, Annul Out
    = New Public, Annul Public, New Private, Annul Private
```

## Leave out the accessible

When *everything* is accessible, then the access control literal may become more complicated. Perhaps lateron you should also invent rules to simplify the access control literal, when most of the things are accessible. A sort of subtractive or exclusion kind of access control literal. Now it is an additive or inclusion kind of access control literal.

## All in all

All in all, the access control literals for parameters can get the following names in the following (chronological) order:

```
( Command )

Object Set Public
    New In
    Annul In
Value Set Public
Data Set Public
Class Set Public
Object Get Private
Value Get Private
Data Get Private
Class Get Private

Execute Private 

Object Set Private
    New Out
    Annul Out

Value Set Private
Data Set Private
Class Set Private
Object Get Public
Class Get Public
Value Get Public
Data Get Public

Execute Public
```

For instance:

```
Object Set Public, Object Get Private, Value Set Private, Value Get Public
```

It is lengthy, but clear.

If __New__ and __Annul__ have the same access control, it might be replaced by a single access control literal on __Existence__.

```
Existence In
Existence Out
Existence Thru
```

The only thing I need to make me completely satisfied with the simplified access control literals, is that good usage of the terms __In__, __Out__ and __Thru__ might replace the terms __Get Public__ , __Set Public__ , __Get Private__ and __Set Private__.

## Replacement that didn’t work out

I thought about replacement of separate access control elements by single ones.

I thought about replacing __Public__ and __Private__ by __Accessible__ when the same system command was both publicly and privately accessible.

I also thought about replacing __Get__ and __Set__ by __Accessible__ when the __Get__ and __Set__ of a system aspect were both accessible the same way.

But that naming resulted in overlap in possibilities. The same access control situation could be expressed in several different ways. And I could *not* come up with an exact rule to pick the clearest naming from a set of overlapping naming possibilities.

When I also tried to apply the terms __In__, __Out__ and __Thru__, then I got really confused. At that point I decided, that I might no longer think about it anymore, and only summarize my existing, unfinished ideas in this article. It did not even turn out that bad and it is a good start anyway.

## Old naming

__Reference Out__ was a parameter access control literal at one point. It meant writing the object on the outside and reading the value from the inside. This is now expressed with the following literal:

```
Object Set Public, Value Set Private
```

You can immediately see what happens from that literal.

What you expect *now* from access controlled parameters, the words __Reference Out__ could imply you write the object on the inside, so the literal for that now is:

```
Object Set Private
```

And __Object Out__ *used* to be the name for reading the object from the outside, and then *possibly* writing it on the inside, which is now the literal:

```
Object Get Public
```

The point is: the naming has changed.  
Below you find a table of new literals for the old parameter passings. This also gives you an idea of the old parameter passings I had in mind:


| Old Name       | New Name                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Value In       | Value Set Public                                     |
| Value Out      | Value Get Public                                     |
| Value Thru     | Value Set Public, Value Get Public                   |
| Reference In   | Object Set Public                                    |
|                | Object, Value, Clone, Data & Class Get Private       |
| Reference Out  | Object Set Public                                    |
|                | Object, Value, Clone, Data & Class Set Private       |
| Reference Thru | Object Set Public                                    |
|                | Object, Value, Clone, Data & Class Get & Set Private |
| Object Out     | Object Get Public                                    |
|                | Object, Value, Clone, Data & Class Get & Set Private |
