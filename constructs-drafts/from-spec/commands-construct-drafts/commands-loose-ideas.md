## Nested Commands

`<< nice formulation >>`  

A nested command also executes, when its parent command executes:

`<< details >>`

but it doesnâ€™t execute, unless you call it.

`<< details >>`

The nested command might be directly contained by a command. So this is not a nested command:

## No Dashed Lines for Commands

A command symbol can define its own command:

But if it has a reference line it is regarded no more than a reference or call to a command. The target of the line is considered the command itself or the *definition* of the command.

*A is the reference, B is the definition:*

*A is the command reference, B is the definition:*

## Misc Ideas

`<< about other technology >>`

Differences with Com with returning object references.

-----

`<< interpretation >>`

- Executions & parameters: Inside directly accessible, outside only 'indirectly' accessible (if line set FOR you)

-----

`<< detail >>`

Alternative to command with return value: an object with a getter: A command might possibly not get its own symbol anyway. It might just be an object with an execution point.
