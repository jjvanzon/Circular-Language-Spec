Take the possibilities of a spread sheet program. The functional definition of all its possibilities is a long story. But creating the functional definition of the program is nothing compared to the manpower needed to realization the program. Imagine that the realization of the program can be done by a hobbyist within a week. And it won't be a cranky program with errors all the time either. Imagine such simplification in making software, that we currently consider complex. Right now, the possibilities of a spread sheet program need to be kept limited, in order to keep the product realizable. A HUGE company has to be building it, in order to have the money and the manpower to implement the ideas. In fact, many features of software packages today do not even change, and bugs in it do not get corrected, and usage is not made more user friendly, because it takes such incredible effort to deliver good software of that degree of complexity. We might actually limit our span of ideas and what we do, in order to keep products realizable. Imagine, that this limitation is taken away. We can allow more ideas into the project, without destroying the planning. We can actually implement all our ideas within the same year instead of having to wait a couple of decennia and spend a couple of billions of currency. Programs could be completely reprogrammed, instead of partially, getting rid of the problems with it within the same year, instead of the next decennium. All features wanted can actually be programmed without destroying the planning never releasing a product.

Imagine that creating the programs most important for our productivity today, no longer needs to be done by huge companies costing humongous amounts of money. It is like not having to worry about our basic needs anymore, so we can start working on what's really important.

If millions of smart programmers and software developers no longer might work years on end to create software. Imagine what they could do with their minds,being able to let their ideas on the loose and actually realizing them as products.

All software we now have might then be easy to program. Any sofware that exists today might relatively take no time at all to program or maintain. We could start having ideas about things we never even imagined possible. Or imagined, but could never realize, because it is too huge, for the whole of humanity to even accomplish.

Systems 1000 times complex than what we consider huge software packages now, could be program with 10% of the people working on it in only 10% of the time.

How might I store the code in the future? Might it be as text code or as a Creator database?

The automatic diagram metrics is also part of the achievability principles. It saves programmers time, by not letting them work hard on positioning
diagram symbols.
