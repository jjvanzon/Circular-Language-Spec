## Bidirectional Relationship Synchronization Implementation Details

`When* you*` let one of `the*` object references link to another object, `then* the*` link from `the*` old counterpart to `the*` object `should` be broken and a link from `the*` new counterpart to `the*` object `should` be established. `The*` object synchronizes `the* old` counterpart *out*, and it synchronizes `the*` new counterpart *in*.

In Circular `you* are` still able to create `just` a unidirectional relationship. In a programming environment `you* should` be able to automatically turn a unidirectional relationship to a bidirectional relationship. In a programming environment `you* should` be able to turn two `already defined` unidirectional relationships into a single bidirectional relationship.

`So` whenever a __Jar__ changes its __Lid__, `the*` original __Lid__’s reference to `the*` __Jar__ `is` annulled, and `the*` new __Lid__ get a reference to its new __Jar__. `This actually` explains synchronization between __1 => 1__ related objects. Synchronization happens `when*` assigning a related item. `When*` assigning a related item, `the*` related item gets a reference back to `the*` first item.

Relationship synchronization happens `when* you*` assign a related object. `When* you*` assign __Lid . Jar__, `then*` synchronizing `the*` relationship, consists of, in turn, assigning __Jar . Lid__.

For `every` relationship type it works in a different way.

There `are` three relationship types:

- __1 <=> 1__
- __1 <=> n__
- __n <=> n__

`But*` synchronization `is` managed separately for `each` end of `the*` relationship, `so` synchronization `is` managed in `the*` following four of ways:

- __1 => 1 synchronization__
- __1 => n synchronization__
- __n => 1 synchronization__
- __n => n synchronization__

### Synchronization Types

There `are` four synchronization types:

- __1 => 1 synchronization__
- __1 => n synchronization__
- __n => 1 synchronization__
- __n => n synchronization__

`Every` synchronization type follows a slightly different procedure, to make `sure` that on assignment of one relationship counterpart, `the*` other relationship counterpart goes along with it.

### 1 => 1 Synchronization

__1 => 1__ synchronization `is quite` easy. In a __Jar =>__ __Lid__ relationship, `when*` assigning __Lid . Jar__, `The* old` __Jar . Lid__ `is` set to __Nothing__, while `the*` new __Jar . Lid__ `is` set to __This__.

### Risk of infinite loop 1 => 1

`When*` a relationship `is` synchronized, `you*` may `have` a risk to an infinite loop.
`When* you*` assign __Jar__ to __Lid__, `then*` __Lid__ `is` assigned to __Jar__, upon which __Jar__ `is` assigned to __Lid__ again, and `so` on. Fortunately, `when*` a __Jar__ `is` assigned a __Lid__ it `already` has, `the*` whole assignment `is not*` executed. `So` it `only` goes as far as: __Jar__ `is` assigned to __Lid__, upon which __Lid__ `is` assigned to __Jar__ again, upon which __Jar__ `is` assigned to __Lid__ again, `but*` __Jar__ `already` had that __Lid__, `so` that assignment `is` never executed.

### 1 => n Synchronization

In a __1 => n__ relationship between __Parents__ and __Children__, `every` time `you*` assign a __Child__ to a __Parent__, __Child . Parent__ `is` overwritten. `The* old` __Child__ `is` assigned __Nothing__ as `the*` __Parent__, and `the*` new __Child__ `is` assigned its new __Parent__.

Also, `the*` original __Child__’s __ID In Parent__ `is` yielded over to `the*` new __Child__. `The*` original __Child__’s __ID In Parent__ `is` reset.

There used `to be` a misunderstanding, that one __Parent__ `could*` reference `the*` same __Child__ multiple times. `But*` that idea `was` abolished, `because* when*` a __Parent__ relates to a __Child__ twice, `the*` __Child__ `has to` relate back to `the*` __Parent__ twice. A __Child__ `can* only have` one __Parent__, `so` it `can*` never relate back to `the*` same __Parent__ twice. Something `like` that `might* require` an __n => n__ relationship, for `the*` __Child__ `to be` able to hold multiple references to `the*` same __Parent__.

### Risk of infinite loop 1 => n

Infinite loops for __n => 1__ synchronization `are` prevented `the*` same way as for __1 => 1__ synchronization. `When* you*` assign a __Parent__ to a __Child__, `The*` __Child__ `is` added to `the*` __Parent__, upon which `the*` __Parent__ `is` again assigned to `the*` __Child__. `But* the*` __Child__ `already` had that __Parent__, `so the*` assignment `is` never executed. `So` that prevents an infinite loop there.

### n => 1 Synchronization

In a __Child  n => 1  Parent__ relationship, `when* you*` change __Child . Parent__, `the*` __Child__ `is` removed from its original __Parent__ and added to `the*` new __Parent__. `So you* can never have the*` same __Child__ in several __Parents__.

A __Child__ `can* not*` appear multiple times in `the*` same __Parent__, `because*` that, in turn, `should` give a __Child__ multiple references back to `the*` __Parent__, `but*` a __Child__ holds `only` one reference to a __Parent__.

### Risk of infinite loop n => 1

`When*` a __1 => n__ relationship `is` synchronized, `you*` may `have` a risk to an infinite loop. `When* you*` add a __Child__ to a __Parent__, `then* the*` __Parent__ `is` assigned to `the*` __Child__, upon which `the*` __Child__ `is` added to `the*` __Parent__ *again*.

An earlier solution proposed for `this, is` that in synchronizing `the*` relationship, `you*` never boldly __Add__ `the*` __Child__ to `the*` __Parent__, `but* you*` execute a __Find Or Add__, which prevents `the*` __Child__ from being added again, `when*` it `is already` in `the*` __Parent__’s list. `This might* have` worked, `but*` n => n synchronization `already required` a different solution, that `might` be more efficient for n => 1 synchronization as well.

`When* you*` assign an item to a list for synchronization purposes, `no` synchronization `is to be` executed on `the*` other side again.  
`You’d* might` call a `special` __List Item Set__ command, accessible `only` to `the*` related class, that simply won’t synchonize back again.

### n => n Synchronization

One *related item* in one object always creates *one related item* inside `the*` other object.

Two items, related to each other in an __n => n__ relationship, `are` always connected to each other, by connecting two `specific` list positions to each other.

In __n => n__ synchronization, __Object A__’s reference to __Object B__ `might` be replaced by a reference to __Object C__. `When*` __Object B__ `is` removed from __Object A__’s list, `then*` __Object A__ `is` also be removed from __Object B__’s list. After that, __Object A__ `is` added to __Object C__’s list.

An item in one list `is` aware of its position in `the*` other list. That makes it easy for an item in one list, to remove itself from `the*` other list.

### Risk of infinite loop n => n

`But* when* you*` add __Object A__ to __Object C__’s list of related items, `then*` __Object C__ `might` try to add itself to __Object A__’s list of related items, upon which __Object A__ `might` add itself to `the*` list of __Object C__ again. An infinite loop `should` be prevented here.

`When*` synchronizing `the*` relationship between two objects in an __n => n__ relationship, `you* might` add a position to `the*` list of `the*` referrer, and next assign an item to `this*` position.

`When* you*` assign an item to a list for synchronization purposes, `no` synchronization `is to be` executed on `the*` other side again.  
`You'd* might` call a `special` __List Item Set__ command, accessible `only` to `the*` related class, that simply won’t synchronize back again.

Another solution opted at first, `was` to execute a __Find Or Add__ for synchronization, instead of executing an normal __Add__ command. That `might*` prevent a related item from being added and added again. `But* then* you* have the*` problem: maybe `the*` same item *`should`* be added twice to `the*` list, `because*` one item `can*` relate to another item multiple times, which also `requires the*` other item to relate back to `the*` first item multiple times. For `each` reference to an item, `the*` item `might have` a reference back to `the*` referrer.

`So the*` new option `is` better: `you* have` a `special` __List Item Set__ command, possibly called by a `special` __Add__ command, used solely for relationship synchronization, that won’t synchronize *back* again.

### `The*` abolished multiplicity of x

Earlier `I` had invented a multiplicity of __x__, which `is` plural, `but* then*` a fixed set of items, for instance three items. `But*` __x__ `can*` be replaced by three separate __=> 1__ relationships. __X__ `was` abolished in particular, `because*` it `might*` cause a `lot` of unpredictable behavior `when*` trying to synchronize `the*` two relationship counterparts, especially in __n/x => n/x__ synchronization.

### Confusions about relationship synchronization

There used `to be` two points at which there `was` confusion about `the*` workings of relationship synchronization.

#### Confusion 1

What `can*` be confusing `is` that, `when*` a __1 => n__ relationship `is` synchronized, it `can*` never be used as an __n => n__ relationship. In `the*` relationship __Parent  1 => n  Child__, `every` time `you*` add a __Child__ to a __Parent__, __Child  .  Parent__ `is` overwritten. `When* you*` change __Child  .  Parent__, `the*` __Child__ `is` removed from its original __Parent__ and added to `the*` new __Parent__. `So you* can*` never `have the*` same __Child__ in several __Parents__. `If* you*` want to use multiple __Parents__, `you* can’t.`

It `is` often easier to `define` something in __1 => n__ relationships, `without` thinking about it, that `the*` backward relationship might be __=> n__ `too. But* when*` a relationship `is` synchronized, `the*` system falls apart `when*` a __1 => n__ `is actually` intended as __n => n__ and `you’re*` trying to *use* it that way.

`This can*` be misconceived as an error in Circular, or an inability of it, while it’s `really just` a wrongly `defined` relationship.

`So then*` it becomes `really important` to `define the* exact` relationship type of something, even `when*` it’s more difficult.

`If* you*` do want to use `the*` __1 => n__ relationship as an __n => n__ relationship, `you*` `should` change `the*` relationship type, `but* you* could*` also choose to split `the*` bidirectional relationship into two unsynchronized unidirectional relationships. However, `you* might` be loosing out on functionality and loosing integrity and coherence of `the*` system.

A system in which `all` relationships `are` bidirectional and given `the*` correct relationship type, functions in perfect harmony and everything `is` logical, correct and solid.

#### Confusion 2

Synchronization `could*` cause confusion in `older` versions of Circular, where `you* have` two bidirectional relationships to `the*` same class, that `are` given `the*` same __Item Object Name__. In that case, one relationship’s counterpart synchronizing back to `the*` related object `could*` affect `the*` other relationship. By default it `is not*` allowed to `have` one class __A__ being __1 =>__ related to multiple classes, in which __A__ has `the*` same __Item Object Name__. That `is only` allowed `if* the*` other relationships `are` made unidirectional, and `not*` bidirectional, or `if*` *melding* `is` enabled. *Melding* `is` a topic, which makes it possible for multiple relationship classes or for instance *progressed objects* (article *Progression)*, `to be` referenced as a single related item, `but*` it `has to be` stated explicitly that `this is the*` intention. See `the*` article *Melding*.

## Implementation around 2004

(Specific implementation in experiment 0.9)

`The*` main unit in a relational structure `is the*` *class*. There `is` a list of *classes*.
`The*` classes `are` tied together with *relationships*. One class `is` tied to another.

`The*` main object that `defines` a relational structure `is the*` __Structure__ object. `The*` __Structure__ object `contains` a __Classes__ collection and a __Relationships__ collection. `If* you*` want to add a class, `you*` do that in `the*` __Classes__ collection. `If* you*` want to add a relationship, `you*` do that in `the*` __Relationships__ collection.

`The*` __Classes__ collection `contains` objects of class __Class__.  
`The*` __Relationships__ collection `contains` objects of class __Relationship__.

`Every` __Class__ `has` an __Attributes__ collection. A __Person Class__, for instance, `could* have` a __Name Attribute__ and an __EmailAddress Attribute__ and more attributes such as __Street__, __HouseNumber__, __ZipCode__, etcetera. A __Class__ also `contains` a __RelatedClasses__ collection, which reflects `all` of `the*` class’s related classes. `You* can’t` add __RelatedClasses__ to `this` collection. `You* might define` relationships in `the*` __Structure.Relationships__ collection and they `might` be *reflected* in `the*` __Class.RelatedClasses__ collection. Other members of `the*` __Class__ class `are*` explained in other sections, `covering` different concepts. However, `all` members `are` briefly explained in a sub section below.

A __Relationship__ consists of two __RelationClasses__. It `contains` two __RelationClass__ objects that `define the*` two classes of `the*` relationship and how they relate to one another.

A __Relationship__ also `defines` whether `the*` relationship `is` __Bidirectional__ or __Unidirectional__, by `the*` __Boolean__ __Bidirectional__ member. `If*` a __Relationship__ `is` __Bidirectional__, `then*` both classes `are` aware of eachother and refer to one another. `If*` a __Relationship__ `is` __Unidirectional__ `then* only` __RelationClassA__ `is` aware of __RelationClassB__ and refers to it, `but*` __RelationClassB__ `is` unaware of __RelationClassA__ and doesn’t refer to it.

Even though a __Bidirectional__ relationship `might*` seem to make __RelationClassA__ and __RelationClassB__ equal opponents, __RelationClassB__ in `many` cases `is the* inferior` one. For instance, in writing XML files, __RelationClassB__ `is` seen as `contained` in __RelationClassA__ and `not* the*` other way around. In that case *direction* of `the*` relationship might matter. However, still in `many` cases __RelationClassA__ and __RelationClassB__ `are` technically equal opponents. `When* you*` keep in mind which __RelationClass__ `is` inferior and which one `is` superior, things `like` XML writing go well automatically. `If* you* are` sloppy with choosing `if*` something `is` __RelationClassA__ or __RelationClassB__, `you* could*` get trouble that makes `you*` obliged to switch `the*` two relationship classes within `the*` relationship, `but*` usually `you*` won’t notice `anything` going `wrong. So` relax, `but*` beware.

`The*` two __RelationClass__ objects `define the*` relationship furtherly.

`The*` member __Class__ of __RelationClass__ `is very important` to set, and it `defines` which class makes part of `the*` relationship. `Define the*` __Class__ in both __RelationClasses__ of `the*` __Relationship__ and `you’ve*` made a relationship between `the*` two classes.

A `very important` member of a __RelationClass__ `is the*` __AbstractNumber__. `This defines` whether a relationship class `is` __1__, __x__ or __n__. `If* you* define the*` __AbstractNumber__ for both of `the*` two relationship classes, `you* can*` for instance make a 1<=>n relationship between `the*` two classes or a x<=>n relationship or whatever. __AbstractNumber__ `is` __1__ by default.

To `define the*` quantity of x, `you*` set __ExactNumber__. For instance, in a 
__Line n<=>2 Point__ relationship, `you* define` for `the*` __Point__ __RelationClass__ that its __AbstractNumber = x__ and its __ExactNumber = 2__.

Two other `important` members of a __RelationClass__ `are` __CreateObjects__ and __EnsureSubObjects__. __CreateObjects__ `is` by default __True__, exceptions `not*` regarded. __CreateObjects__ says that `when*` a new position `is` created within `the*` related list, an object `is` instantly *created* in that position (See *Objects and Object Positions*). In `many` cases `you*` want that to happen. Sometimes `you*` don’t want objects `to be` created, `because* you’d*` want to assign an object to that position yourself. `Then* you*` set __CreateObjects__ to __False__. Furtherly, __EnsureObjects__ `might` see to it that `you* can’t*` assign __Nothing__ to `the*` object position. It `is` __True__ by default, `but* can*` be set to __False__. For more information see `the*` sections *Create Objects* and *Ensure Objects*.

And `then*` there’s another member of __RelationClass__ that `is important` to mention. And that `is` __ListType__. __ListType__ `is usually` set to __NormalListType__, `but* can*` also be set to __ReferenceCountedListType__, __RegistrationListType__, __SharedListType__ or __SelectionListType__. `The*` list `then*` gets `very special` behavior. For more information see `the*` *Specialized Lists* section. Although `I` don’t explain them here `very` thoroughly, __ListType__ might `mean` a `lot` for `the*` general structure of `the*` system.

`You* can*` see that inside a __RelationClass__ object, `much` more `is defined` than `just the*` __Class__. That`’s` why __RelationClass__ `is` a separate class. `Many` times `I might` speak of a relationship class, and `you*` shouldn’t confuse it with `just` a class `then*, because*` it `might` be defining a class as it `is` in `the*` context of a relationship.

`The*` elements as `I’ve` described them in `this` section, form `the*` following structure of  __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.

```

```

`Every` other concept of J Data `is` hung up on `this` main structure of __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.

For instace, `the*` physical appearance in the user interface of a list `defined` in a __RelationClass__ with __AbstractNumber = n__, `is defined` inside that __RelationClass__ object. `The*` whole appearance of a __List Control__ `is defined` inside a __RelationClass__. That `is` an example of how `the*` user interface `is defined` right inside `the*` general structure above. `The*` same way *`all`* of `the*` application’s features `are defined` in `the*` context of `the*` relational structure of __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.
