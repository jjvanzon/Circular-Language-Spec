`[ Out of Scope ]`

Experiment 0.9 may have been less clear cut, because it allowed adding custom text code to any of the classes or modules, whenever the generated code might not suffice. In Experiment 2.0 and 3.0 you might not be able to do that. You may be compelled to declaring any variable or object as an attribute or a relation. That might make a program defined in a clearer way.
