### Brainstorm

A strategy you could have is to ignore the expression of sequence order for now for experiment 3.0, and pick one later when the rest is up and running. You can have to base up and running and ignore the expression of this concept. So the concept is implemented, but the expression is not. Yet another limitation to impose onto the first version of experiment 3.0.

### Order Matters

*This seems documentation about experiment 0.9: an experimental app, a code generator, in which a program might be based on classes and their relations.*

This is a value you can set to __True__ in a => n relation, that should aid in picking the right data structure for the relation. The only thing it was come up for, was to base picking either hole list or linked list on variables that had no technical meaning, but only functional meaning. I assumed that there might be more list structures that can be chosen if __OrderMatters__ or __Not__.

That’s all there is to say about it for now.

The __OrderMatters__ properties are not used by J Data Generator.

Apart from __RelationClass__, __Class__ also has an __OrderMatters__ property intended to set __OrderMatters__ for all __RelationClasses__ of that __Class__.

### Class . OrderMatters
