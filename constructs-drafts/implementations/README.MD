Circular Language | Construct Drafts
====================================

Implementations

`[ Out of Scope ]`

Topics in this folder may have been left out of the spec, because of a decision not to cover *implementations* and applications of the diagram notation. Internal workings may not be that essential for conveying ideas about this diagram language.

Here might be some of the topics that could be found here:

- ### [Achievability](achievability)

    - The achievability principles might be a set of principles, that describe how a running Circular might be developed in a limited amount of time with a limited amount of people: what techniques might be employed to try and make that possible.

- ### [Applications](applications.md)

    - Misc ideas about applications using Circular language.

- ### [Attributes Are Objects Implementation](attributes-are-objects-implementation.md)

    - Implementation notes about when attributes, simple values an object might hold, might regarded the same as sub-objects, but then ones with specific characteristics, a topic that may also be found under *Broader View*.

- ### [Black Boxes Implementation](black-boxes-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Classes Implementation | Texts to Incorporate](classes-implementation-texts-to-incorporate.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Clear Cut Coding Principles Implementation](clear-cut-coding-principles-implementation.md)

    - Notes about implementation issues regarding the idea of having *clear cut coding principles*, a topic that may also be found under *Broader View*.

- ### Code Editor

    - On top of text code being constructed and parsed, text code may also separately require a code editor for use in a programming environment.

- ### [Commands Implementation](commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Comparison to CPU-Like Calls](comparison-to-cpu-like-calls.md)

    - Moved here from the spec section about Commands, since it looks more like an implementation issue of how call instantion in Circular might relate to how a CPU may handle procedure calls.

- ### [Errors & Warnings Implementation](errors-and-warnings-implementation.md)

    - Implementation ideas of how perhaps to handle errors & warnings in applications that might use Circular language.

- ### [Exchangeability Implementation](exchangeability-implementation.md)

    - Implementation issues around the exchangeability ideas, a topic that may also be found under *Broader View*.

- ### [Implementation Attempt 2002](implementation-attempt-2002.md)

    - Document about a more serious attempt from 2002 to make a programming environment that might use the Circular notation.

- ### [Implementations Loose Ideas](implementations-loose-ideas.md)

    - Uncategorized ideas about implementations.

- ### [Optimization](optimization.md)

    - May cover optimization algorithms, that might be integrated into Circular. For now this is considered not so important to think about. The text might just be loose ideas.

- ### [Referrers Implementation](referrers-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Relationships Implementation](relationships-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Sequence Order Implementation](sequence-order-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [Start & Stop Implementation](start-and-stop-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.

- ### [System Commands Implementation](system-commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the spec of the language, but are more like an application of it.
