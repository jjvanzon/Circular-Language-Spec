Shadowing,
 
A shadowed type or object is special in the diagrams:
in text code it makes sense, the name is shadowed, but in a diagram it is like
based on something's name, references are pulled towards it,
like a magnet.
The references ARE tied to the object behind the shadowing object,
because when you remove the shadowing object, they need to be retied,
but somehow the shadowing object draws, based on its name.
Well, not exactly... based on its name it might start shadowing a certain other
object, then it is tied to the other object as its shadower, no longer
based on its name. But then the references to the one shadowed
are  drawn to the shadower like a magnet.
