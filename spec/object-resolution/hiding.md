- ( not the same as another concept? )
- Accessing a hidden name

2004,

If there are multiple commands and variables with the same name, Visual Basic takes the value of the more local variable, which in this case, is the Form1 variable.

References to the name Temp within the command might access the local variable; references to Temp outside the command might access the public variable. The module-level variable can be accessed from within the command by qualifying the variable with the module name
