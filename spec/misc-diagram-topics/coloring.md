Coloring
--------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

### From the Original Symbol Documentation

Coloring is een analyse methode 

#### Hierarchies

< This was the old way to express classes, before it became a special kind of line. But the below might give an idea about that you can use coloring for expressing hierarchy depth. >

Another way to see the type/object structure is by coloring the symbols. It can be used to graphically fully expose the inheritance structure.  
< 2008-10-10 I used to call the class-object relations the inheritance structure.>

< 2008-10-10 I used to have nothing to express the relation between an object and its class. I did not have dashed class lines here. >

The above shows all smaller circles in blue. That means that all three have the same type. The darker blue circle is the type of the lighter blue ones. Color depth can express the depth of the type/object hierarchy, like the depth of encapsulation is expressed by the size and residence of the circles. There is a standard complex way of doing this coloring. I might elaborate on this later. 

### Other Ideas

2004,

You can use colors coloring diagram elements to denote which diagram aspect represents which system aspect.

Just like in text code, coloring is not something mandatory, but darn handy anyway.

Originally from the Relationships chapter:

`If* the*` dashed lines do `not*` emphasize `the*` classes and relationships enough, a coloring `could*` be applied to `the*` diagram, highlighting `all the*` classes and their relationships to other classes.

`If* just the*` use of dashed lines might `not*` emphasize `the*` classes and relationships enough, a coloring `could*` be applied to `the*` diagram, highlighting `all the*` classes and relationships.
